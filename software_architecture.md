# Software architecture

To make development and enhancement easier developers try to structure their software in a certain way. 
Functionalities get divided into specific parts and they define how functionalities from one part can talk to another
one from a different part.

## Ruby gem
A short recap:
> We have a `lib` folder which contains all stuff which belongs to the app. There is also a `bin` folder which contains the executable (to use your app from command line). 

The executable in `bin` ties together certain parts of your application. For example ataru:
There is a class for Markdown traversing, there is a class for executing the code examples and there is also some code which reads a file. 
All those parts don’t know each other. Only the executable does. The functionalities in `lib` do not know that there is an executable.

```
-----------------------------------------
|               bin/ataru               |    |   You can only look down
-----------------------------------------    |
|               lib                     |    v
-----------------------------------------
```

It looks like this, here you have two layers:
- `bin/ataru`
- `lib`

It is good design when classes only “can look down” which means, `bin` sees `lib` but `lib` does not see `bin`. 
If there would be another layer below `lib`, `bin` and `lib` would see it but not vice versa.


## Layers

When applications get bigger, in general they consist of those three layers:

```
-----------------------------------------
|        view/ user interaction         |
-----------------------------------------
|           domain/logic                |
-----------------------------------------
|           infrastructure              |
-----------------------------------------

```

### User interaction

The general rule is, user interaction (Getting input from the user and showing stuff to the user) happens only at the top layer. All other layers do not interact directly with the user. This means, no `puts` or `gets` are allowed. User input must be passed from the top layer down to the other layers.
In context of a GUI application (desktop or web) developers often name this the view layer because it presents the information in a certain way.

The view / user interaction layer uses the domain layer. But it does not use the infrastructure directly.

### Domain / Logic

This is the "intelligent" and most important part of your application. As an example of a web shop: 
The web shop's domain layer processes the orders, manages the shopping card and checks if an article is in stock and so on. 
The domain layer uses the infrastructure layer to get and store data. But the domain layer does not know anything about the layer above.

### Infrastructure

In this layer you do file operations, talk with your database or with third party services. The infrastructure layer does not know about any of the other layers above.

## Single responsibility

In general, when you write a new class, the class itself shouldn't know anything about the outside world. What does this mean?

See this example:

```ruby
username = "John"

class Greeter
  def greet(name)
    puts "HELLO #{name}"
  end
end
```
Here you have a `Greeter` class. Its purpose is to greet people. You create a new instance of `Greeter` with `my_greeter = Greeter.new`. And then you can greet people by calling the greet method `my_greeter.greet(username)`. 
The important part here is, the greet method accepts a parameter `name` and it greets somebody with this name. The `Greeter` class doesn't care from where this name comes. Its only *responsibility* is to greet somebody. The name could come from a database, a file or direct user input from command line. Getting the name is other code's *responsibility*. So you can reuse the `Greeter` class in many ways.
